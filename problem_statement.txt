Purpose of the Exercise
 
The purpose of the exercise is two-fold. Firstly, we want to validate technical skills using a JVM programming language and a streaming framework that you are familiar with (Storm, Flink, Spark, etc). Secondly, we want to assess engineering practices.

Submission Requirements
 
	•	Use Java, Kotlin or Scala and provide testing evidence.
	•	Code and documentation need to be uploaded to GitHub along with tests cases.
 
Data Source
 
The dataset can be downloaded from IMDB https://datasets.imdbws.com/. Please note that this dataset is just an example, the application should be expected to handle millions of records.
 
Problem Statement
 
Your task is to write a streaming application that can answer the following questions using the imdb data set.
 
1. Retrieve the top 10 movies with a minimum of 500 votes with the ranking determined by:
(numVotes/averageNumberOfVotes) * averageRating
 
2. For these 10 movies, list the persons who are most often credited and list the
different titles of the 10 movies.
 
The application should:
-          be runnable on a local machine
-          have documentation on how to execute
-          be reproducible
